# Content: Computer Vision
## Project: Facial Recognition


In this project I used HAAR Cascades to detect face and create the dataset required by capturing images of the user from the video frames. Then Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) to validate whether the face was that of the user and print the accuracy level of the prediction.

## Libraries
* OpenCV
* Python 2.7
